	<h1>Time Complexity and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running efficient</p>
	<p>The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm or a data structure is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm until it executes completely.space complexity is often expressed asymptotically in O(n)</p>
